    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> A baked potato, known in some parts of the United Kingdom (though not generally Scotland) as a jacket potato, is a preparation of potato. 
        The ideal baked potato has a fluffy interior and a crispy skin.It may be served with fillings, toppings or condiments such as butter, cheese,
         sour cream, gravy, baked beans, and even ground meat or corned beef. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Potatoes can be baked in a conventional gas or electric oven, a convection oven, a microwave oven, on a barbecue grill, or on (or in) an open fire.
         Some restaurants use special ovens designed specifically to cook large numbers of potatoes, then keep them warm and ready for service.
