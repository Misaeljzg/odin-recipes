    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> A sandwich is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or meat, placed on or between slices of bread, 
        or more generally any dish wherein bread serves as a container or wrapper for another food type. The sandwich 
        began as a portable, convenient finger food in the Western world, though over time it has become prevalent worldwide. 
        In the 21st century there has been considerable debate over the precise definition of sandwich; and specifically whether 
        a hot dog or open sandwich can be categorized as such. In the United States, the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration are the responsible agencies. 
        The USDA uses the definition, "at least 35% cooked meat and no more than 50% bread" for closed sandwiches, and "at least 50% cooked meat" for open sandwiches.

        Sandwiches are a popular type of lunch food, taken to work, school, or picnics to be eaten as part of a packed lunch. The bread may be plain or be coated with condiments,
         such as mayonnaise or mustard, to enhance its flavour and texture. As well as being homemade, sandwiches are also widely sold in various retail outlets and can be served hot or cold. 
         There are both savoury sandwiches, such as deli meat sandwiches, and sweet sandwiches, such as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided </li>
        <li>3/4 cup frozen chopped broccoli, thawed </li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely chopped sweet onion</li>
        <li>4 slices whole grain sliced bread</li>
        <li>4 slices sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add broccoli and onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
        <li>Distribute sauteed vegetables evenly on 2 slices of bread. Place 2 slices Cheddar cheese over the vegetables, season with garlic powder, and top with remaining 2 slices of bread.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, tilting the skillet to distribute the butter evenly as it melts. Place the sandwiches into the skillet and cook until the bottom piece of bread is golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
